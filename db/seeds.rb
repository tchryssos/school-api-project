# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# troy = Student.create(name: "Troy", grade: 12, quote: "Everything in the world is like that.")
# daniella= Student.create(name: "Daniella", grade: 10, quote: "Look how self-centered I am.")
#
# frizzle= Teacher.create(name: "Ms. Frizzle", subject: "science", quote: "Get dirty and make mistakes!")
